**System driver (MS-DOS 6.22) for the ALFI coordinate printer (plotter).**

 - However ! It is necessary to convert the original 8-bit PC interface to the 16-bit PC interface, i.e. to LPT - parallel port. Unfortunately, I don't remember exactly how or which pins I connected - on the LPT port, personally, years ago.

 - The source code and EXE files are from 1999, which is a very long time ago now (2025 is the year of the code and EXE files being uploaded to GitHub). At that time I was just starting out as a young beginner programmer. So I don't remember much and unfortunately I can't give any feedback :). But it should work. Of course, even EXE files can only be run with OS restrictions, so only on an MS-DOS system, or on a good PC-machine emulator (VMware Workstation, with MS-DOS installed and with an active and configured parallel port).
